# SIEMENS-Project-Management

Project Overview:
This virtual simulation focused on managing a large-scale urban rail expansion project for the city of Metroville. The project aimed to improve public transport connectivity, address peak-hour congestion, and align with the city's sustainability goals. Key challenges included complex terrain, electrification delays, community feedback, and budget management.

Task Given:

1. Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) to track project performance across technical, environmental, and community impact areas.

2. Analyze and summarize project updates from engineering, field, and stakeholder teams.

3. Create a stakeholder-facing dashboard to visually present project progress, electrification status, and budget metrics.

What I Did:

1. Designed 6 strategic KPIs focusing on construction progress, electrification milestones, COâ‚‚ reduction, green space development, community sentiment, and accessibility compliance.

2. Collected and synthesized weekly updates from engineering, field supervisors, and community relations.

3. Built a dashboard in Microsoft Excel using charts, conditional formatting, and visual indicators to communicate real-time progress, risks, and budget status.
